Adds steam tracker Category Summary showing total games, how many are banned, delisted, F2P unavailable, Purchase Disabled and unreleased, also appends the tag after the name in the dropdown so that you can visually see the info there aswell, pairs really well with https://github.com/encumber/BoosterSearch to allow you to search by only those items
