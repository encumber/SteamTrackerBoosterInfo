Adds steam tracker Category Summary showing total games, how many are banned, delisted, F2P unavailable, Purchase Disabled and unreleased, also appends the tag after the name in the dropdown so that you can visually see the info there aswell, pairs really well with https://github.com/encumber/BoosterSearch to allow you to search by only those items

## Contact
feel free to add me on discord io7 or add me on [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/client)

if you want to support me the best ways are either by sending me a [Trade Offer](https://steamcommunity.com/tradeoffer/new/?partner=1053762784&token=sjVuSqZ0) on steam or by adding me and asking for a crypto address, any money that I get from this will go towards the robotics team that I mentor as that is where I find the most enjoyment in life currently.
